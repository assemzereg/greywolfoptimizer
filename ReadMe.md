The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm proposed in 2014 by Seyedali Mirjalili et al. The algorithm is based on the hunting behavior of grey wolves in the wild, where the wolves exhibit hierarchical social structure and cooperative hunting behavior.

In GWO, a population of candidate solutions (i.e., individuals) is initialized randomly and updated iteratively based on the behavior of alpha, beta, and delta wolves. These wolves represent the best, second-best, and third-best solutions found so far, respectively. The other individuals in the population move towards these three wolves based on a spiral updating rule, which promotes exploration in the early stages of the optimization process and exploitation in the later stages.

GWO has been shown to be effective in solving a wide range of optimization problems, including function optimization, feature selection, and neural network training. The algorithm is relatively simple to implement and does not require many tuning parameters. However, like many nature-inspired optimization algorithms, the performance of GWO can be sensitive to the choice of population size, iteration count, and other algorithmic parameters.
